Linear Regression equation for housing data using weka is:

class =
     -0.1084 * CRIM +
      0.0458 * ZN +
      2.7187 * CHAS=1 +
    -17.376  * NOX +
      3.8016 * RM +
     -1.4927 * DIS +
      0.2996 * RAD +
     -0.0118 * TAX +
     -0.9465 * PTRATIO +
      0.0093 * B +
     -0.5226 * LSTAT +
     36.3411

The linear regression equation consists of 11 attributes to predict the class (MEDV) value. The equation does not include 2 attributes which are AGE and INDUS, the reaseon for this exclusion might be the disctribution of teh data corresponding of AGE and INDUS is not coverging with the minear regression model, which is they are not related to class (MEDV) attribute, cannot be used to predict the class attribute. Time taken to build model: 0.14 seconds

Linear Regression equation for shells data using KNIME is:

num_rings = (-0.8249 * sex=I) + (0.0577 * sem=M) + (-0.4583 * length) + (11.0751 * diameter) + (10.7615 * height) + (8.9754 * whole_wieght) + (-19.7869 * shucked_weight) + (-10.5818 * viscera_weight) + (8.7418 * shell_weight) + 3.8946


Linear Regression euqtion for shells data using Rapid Miner is:

num_rings = (-11.933 * length) + (25.766 * diameter) + (20.358 * height) + 2.836
